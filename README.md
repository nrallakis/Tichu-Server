# Tichu Server
This is an **incomplete** server implementation for the game of [Tichu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu).<br>
Written using the cross platform library [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) in Java & Kryonet, when I was 15 years old.<br><br>
#### There is also a client [implementation](https://github.com/nrallakis/Tichu-Server](https://github.com/nrallakis/Tichu-Online/blob/master/README.md)https://github.com/nrallakis/Tichu-Online/blob/master/README.md).
